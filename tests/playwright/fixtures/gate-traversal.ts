/**
 * gate-traversal.ts — RoomGate traversal walk helper for Playwright specs
 *
 * This fixture encodes the harness-side discipline for driving Embergrave's
 * RoomGate state machine through Playwright keyboard input. It is intended
 * to let specs traverse Rooms 02..08 (which all use a RoomGate at
 * world-position (48, 144) with size (48, 80)) end-to-end.
 *
 * **HARNESS COVERAGE GAP — phase boundaries vs gameplay event ordering
 * (ticket 86c9ugfzv, PR #221's surfacing finding):** prior to this fix, the
 * helper assumed the gate was always OPEN with `mobs_alive == 0` when invoked
 * — phase 3's walk-in would fire `body_entered #1` → `lock()` →
 * `_unlock()` synchronously (because `_mobs_alive == 0` triggers the
 * short-circuit). That precondition holds for the "kill mobs first AT spawn,
 * THEN walk to gate" pattern.
 *
 * **It does NOT hold when combat happens NEAR the gate trigger.** In Room 03
 * (the Grunt + Charger chase-combat room), the player drifts INTO the
 * trigger BEFORE the last mob dies. The 86c9ugfzv 8-run sweep empirically
 * confirmed the sequence (every Room 03 trace shows `state=locked` on the
 * very first `_on_mob_died` line — i.e. `lock()` ran before any decrement):
 *   1. **During the room-load / settle window (between Room N-1's
 *      `gate_traversed` and Room N's first `clearRoomMobs` call):** Room N
 *      loads, mobs spawn near the gate, the player's teleport-to-spawn
 *      combined with chase-knockback drifts the player INTO the trigger
 *      → `body_entered #1` fires → state OPEN → `lock()` → state LOCKED
 *      (mobs_alive>0, no unlock yet).
 *   2. Mobs die one-by-one via the deferred `_on_mob_died` decrement chain.
 *   3. When the last mob's decrement lands and `_mobs_alive == 0` with state
 *      == LOCKED, the gate starts its 650ms DEATH_TWEEN_WAIT and then fires
 *      `_unlock()` → state UNLOCKED, `gate_unlocked` emits.
 *   4. `gateTraversalWalk` is then invoked from the spec, but its phase-3
 *      logic assumes the gate is OPEN — it walks into the trigger, sees no
 *      new `gate_unlocked` event (already fired at step 3), and throws.
 *
 * **Symptom:** misleading error "phase 3 fired _on_body_entered but
 * gate_unlocked did NOT follow" — the body_entered seen is actually Room
 * 04's gate firing on the newly-spawned Shooter (because Room 03's gate
 * actually traversed silently when phase 4's east-walk produced a re-entry
 * into the still-UNLOCKED trigger). Not a state-machine regression — the
 * helper just doesn't account for cross-phase `_unlock` events that landed
 * during the spec's preceding combat phase.
 *
 * **The fix (this PR — Drew, ticket 86c9ugfzv):** accept an optional
 * `preRoomLineCount` snapshot from the caller (line count BEFORE
 * clearRoomMobs began) and resolve the room's gate state by scanning the
 * combat-phase trace lines for `_unlock` / `gate_traversed` events. Three
 * outcomes mirror the kiting-mob-chase fixture's case A/B/C resolution:
 *   - Case A: `gate_traversed` already fired during combat → return early
 *     (room counter has advanced; the spec MUST NOT call this helper again
 *     for the same room).
 *   - Case B: `gate_unlocked` fired but no `gate_traversed` → steer
 *     EAST-of-trigger, then walk pure-WEST to fire body_entered →
 *     gate_traversed. Skip the lock-induction phase entirely.
 *   - Case C: neither fired → existing phase 3-5 walk (the open-gate path).
 * See `.claude/docs/combat-architecture.md § "Harness coverage gap —
 * phase boundaries vs gameplay event ordering"` for the broader pattern.
 *
 * **HISTORY — body_entered hypothesis was overturned by Devon's investigation
 * (PR #171, ticket 86c9qbhm5):** Tess PR #170 conjectured that body_entered
 * was not firing under Playwright + Chromium HTML5. Devon's regression canary
 * `tests/playwright/specs/room-gate-body-entered-regression.spec.ts` proved
 * 5/5 reliable firing when the player walks from `DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN =
 * (240, 200)` into Room02's gate via `W 2000ms then N 1500ms`. The real root
 * cause of the AC4 spec's null result was **player drift during long combat
 * in Rooms 02-08** — the prior `clearRoomMobs` helper used an aim-sweep
 * (cycling through 8 directions) plus knockback feedback, which accumulated
 * 100+px of westward+northward displacement before the gate-traversal walk.
 * From the drifted position, the helper's W→N pattern landed against the
 * north/west wall *outside* the trigger rect.
 *
 * **Harness rule that flowed out of the investigation:** combat that
 * precedes a precise spawn-relative walk (like the gate traversal) MUST
 * stay tight — NE-facing only, no aim-sweep — so the player remains within
 * a small radius of `DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN`. AC4's `clearRoomMobs` was
 * updated accordingly. The `gateTraversalWalk` helper now also accepts an
 * optional `expectedSpawn` parameter so the spec can assert "we are still
 * near spawn" via the `[combat-trace] RoomGate._on_body_entered` line — if
 * the body_entered fails to fire, we throw with explicit drift diagnostics
 * instead of silently failing on the gate_unlocked check.
 *
 * Why this helper exists (the two failure modes it fixes):
 *
 * 1. **Gate trigger Y-band misses player spawn Y.**
 *    `RoomGate._ensure_collision_shape` constructs a `RectangleShape2D` with
 *    `size = trigger_size` centred on the gate node's position. With
 *    `room_gate_position = (48, 144)` and `room_gate_size = (48, 80)`, the
 *    trigger occupies world-coords `X ∈ [24, 72]` and `Y ∈ [104, 184]`.
 *    The Player spawns at `DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN = (240, 200)` — 16px SOUTH
 *    of the band and 168px EAST of the X range. A pure-west walk from spawn
 *    NEVER intersects the trigger because the spawn Y=200 is below the band.
 *    The player must walk **diagonally NW** (north + west) for both axes to
 *    enter the rectangle.
 *
 * 2. **`RoomGate` state machine requires TWO distinct `body_entered` events.**
 *    State chain (see `scripts/levels/RoomGate.gd`):
 *
 *        OPEN
 *         │  body_entered #1 (CharacterBody2D inside trigger rect)
 *         ▼
 *        LOCKED      ── all mobs dead → DEATH_TWEEN_WAIT_SECS (0.65s) ──┐
 *                                                                       │
 *                                                                       ▼
 *                                                                  UNLOCKED
 *                                                                       │
 *                                                                       │  body_entered #2
 *                                                                       ▼
 *                                                                  gate_traversed
 *
 *    In Godot 4, `body_entered` is a **non-overlap → overlap transition
 *    event**. A continuous walk through the trigger fires `body_entered`
 *    EXACTLY ONCE — not on every physics tick the body remains inside.
 *    To produce two separate events the player must either (a) exit the
 *    trigger between the two entries, or (b) approach the trigger fresh
 *    for the second event after a clean room reload.
 *
 *    **The spec must drive the body OUT (`body_exited`) before re-entering
 *    for the second event.** This is the "two-part walk" pattern below.
 *
 * The two-part walk pattern (kill-first variant — preferred for Playwright
 * because mobs are NE of player spawn, so combat happens away from the
 * gate trigger):
 *
 *   Phase 1 (combat — gate stays OPEN):
 *     Stand near DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN attacking NE; gate is OPEN with
 *     `mobs_alive == N`. No body_entered fires because we never enter the
 *     trigger rect during combat.
 *
 *   Phase 2 (after last mob dies — gate is still OPEN, mobs_alive == 0):
 *     The death-counter logic only runs when state == LOCKED, so dying
 *     mobs while OPEN do NOT advance state. The state chain pivots
 *     differently here — `lock()` short-circuits to `_unlock()` when
 *     entered with mobs_alive==0, but ONLY when triggered by body_entered
 *     transitioning OPEN → LOCKED. So we still need to walk into the
 *     trigger to LOCK + immediately UNLOCK in one event, then walk out
 *     and back in for the gate_traversed event.
 *
 *   Phase 3 (walk-in #1 — fires body_entered #1):
 *     Walk NW from spawn into the gate trigger. `_on_body_entered` sees
 *     state == OPEN, calls `lock()`. `lock()` sees `_mobs_alive <= 0` and
 *     immediately calls `_unlock()` synchronously — state becomes UNLOCKED
 *     and `gate_unlocked` emits. (No DEATH_TWEEN_WAIT delay because mobs
 *     died while in OPEN state — the timer only arms during LOCKED→UNLOCKED.)
 *
 *   Phase 4 (walk-out — fires body_exited):
 *     Walk SE back to spawn area. `body_exited` fires (a no-op on the
 *     gate's signal handlers — but it lets the next body_entered fire).
 *
 *   Phase 5 (walk-in #2 — fires body_entered #2 → gate_traversed):
 *     Walk NW back into the gate trigger. `_on_body_entered` sees state
 *     == UNLOCKED, fires `gate_traversed` exactly once (idempotent guard
 *     `_traversed_emitted`). MultiMobRoom listens here and emits
 *     `room_cleared` → Main loads the next room → player teleported back
 *     to DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN in the new room.
 *
 * **Why kill-first instead of lock-first?** Either order produces a valid
 * traversal (lock → kill → unlock-via-death-wait → traverse OR open →
 * kill → walk-in-locks-and-unlocks-immediately → exit → walk-in-traverses).
 * Kill-first is simpler from a spec perspective:
 *   - Combat happens around spawn position; we don't have to navigate the
 *     player to the gate first while mobs are still attacking.
 *   - We avoid the 650ms DEATH_TWEEN_WAIT delay between gate_unlocked and
 *     traversal-readiness — the gate is already UNLOCKED by the time we
 *     walk in for the second body_entered.
 *   - The negative-assertion sweep (gate_traversed must come after
 *     gate_unlocked) is preserved: the unlock fires on body_entered #1, the
 *     traversal fires on body_entered #2, in correct causal order.
 *
 * Geometry (DEFAULT_PLAYER_SPAWN → gate trigger):
 *   Player at (240, 200). Trigger at (48, 144) with size (48, 80) → world
 *   bounds X∈[24, 72], Y∈[104, 184]. Player must land BOTH X and Y inside
 *   the rect SIMULTANEOUSLY for `body_entered` to fire.
 *
 *   The naïve NW-diagonal walk fails: the X-distance-to-cover (192px) is
 *   far larger than the Y-distance-to-cover (only 16-96px to enter, with
 *   Y exiting the north edge after ~96px). At equal NW speed (120/√2 ≈
 *   84.85 px/s on each axis), Y enters and EXITS the band before X gets
 *   close to entering — the two intersection windows never overlap. The
 *   body never enters the trigger rect.
 *
 *   Two-segment walk fix: walk pure WEST first (full 120 px/s on X) until
 *   X is firmly inside [24, 72], THEN walk pure NORTH (full 120 px/s on Y)
 *   to descend into the Y-band. While moving north, X stays inside the
 *   X-band the whole time, so the body_entered transition fires when Y
 *   crosses the south edge (Y = 184).
 *
 *   West segment: 240 → ~36 needs ~204px / 120 px/s = 1.7s. We use 2000ms
 *   (2.0s) for safety margin against velocity loss / wall-sliding. The
 *   player ends near X=20 — slightly past the west edge X=24 — but they'll
 *   be against the room west wall (CharacterBody2D collision-resolves) so
 *   final X settles inside the room bounds.
 *
 *   North segment: 200 → ~144 needs ~56px / 120 px/s = 0.47s. We use
 *   1200ms (1.2s) which puts the player around Y=56, a touch past the
 *   north edge Y=104. They'll be against the room north wall similarly.
 *   The walk DOES briefly cross the trigger rect between Y=184 and Y=104
 *   (~666ms inside), which is plenty for the physics tick to fire
 *   body_entered.
 *
 *   Combined walk-in time: 2.0s + 1.2s = 3.2s. The walk-out (SE) reverses
 *   the pattern: south + east simultaneously is OK because the player
 *   starts NEAR the gate (small distance) — overshoot is fine because
 *   we're going BACK to the spawn area.

/**

 * lands at X=48 (center of band [24, 72]). We use 1700 ms to land at

 * (the wall sits at X=0 and the player CharacterBody2D's collision shape
 * clamps the centre to roughly X≈16 when pinned to the wall, which would

 *
 * Why we can't just walk further: walking too far west pins the player
 * against the wall at X≈16 (outside the trigger X-band [24, 72]). The

  //      called. Return immediately. The spec MUST guard against
  //      double-traversal (the room counter has advanced; calling this
  //      helper would operate on the NEXT room's still-LOCKED gate).
  //   B. UNLOCKED but not traversed — `gate_unlocked` fired before the
  //      helper was called but no `gate_traversed`. Steer EAST-of-trigger
  //      (the player may be inside the trigger right now, or anywhere — we
  //      normalise position via key bursts), then walk pure-west to fire
  //      body_entered → gate_traversed on the UNLOCKED gate.
  //   C. Still OPEN — neither fired before the helper. Take the existing
  //      phase 3-5 walk (the open-gate path).
  //
  // **Scan-start computation (ticket 86c9ugfzv N=2 sweep finding):** the
  // first cut of this resolution used `[preRoomLineCount, preLineCount)`
  // — i.e. only events emitted during `clearRoomMobs`. That MISSED gate
  // events that fire BETWEEN the previous room's `gate_traversed` and the
  // current room-loop iteration start (e.g. the 800ms settle window
  // between iterations, during which Room N+1's `_assemble_room_fixtures`
  // runs and the player can drift into the new gate's trigger from the
  // teleport-to-spawn). For Room 03 specifically, every observed run in
  // the first 8-run sweep showed `_on_mob_died` traces with the gate
  // already in `state=locked` at the first mob death — proving
  // `_on_body_entered → lock()` fired BEFORE `preRoomLineCount`. So we
  // expand the scan slice: scan from `[previousRoomGateTraversedIndex+1,
  // preLineCount)` — i.e. everything since the previous gate's traversal
  // (or from 0 if there was no previous gate). That captures the load /
  // settle window AND combat.
  //
  // **Why this resolution lives in the helper, not the spec:** the helper is
  // the single point of truth for "how to make Room N traverse." Every
  // future spec that drives Rooms 02..08 inherits the fix transparently.
  // Putting case resolution at the spec level would require every future
  // AC spec to re-implement the same A/B/C ladder. See the module header
  // for rationale.
  //
  // **Compatibility:** when `preRoomLineCount` is omitted (legacy callers),
  // the resolution scan is skipped and the helper falls through to the
  // existing phase 3-5 path — preserving pre-86c9ugfzv behavior for any
  // spec that hasn't been migrated.

//   - Staging point: `(120, 144)` — 48px east of the trigger east edge,
//     vertically centred in the Y-band. Far enough outside the trigger
//     that the player is GUARANTEED to be in the non-overlap state before
//     the walk begins (so `body_entered` fires fresh on the next entry).
//     Y=144 is the rect's vertical centre, so a subsequent pure-west walk
//     keeps the player Y-locked inside the trigger Y-band.
//   - Walk: pure WEST for ~1100ms → covers ~132px → player crosses the
//     trigger east edge (X=72) at ~t=400ms, firing body_entered →
//     gate_traversed on the UNLOCKED gate.
//
// **Position-steered approach (ticket 86c9ugfzv N=4 sweep finding):** the
// earlier blind east-burst + west-walk approach failed in Room 03 because
// after chase-combat the player's Y position is unpredictable (knockback
// pushes them N out of the trigger Y-band). Walking pure-west from a Y
// outside the band never crosses the trigger rect. The position-steered
