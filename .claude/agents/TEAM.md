# Embergrave / RandomGame — Agent Team

Five named agents handle the Embergrave game build. The Sponsor (Thomas) talks to the **orchestrator** (the Claude Code session). The orchestrator fans out directly to Priya, Uma, Devon, Drew, and Tess via the `Agent` tool. **Nested-Agent spawning is unsupported** in this Claude Code build (see *Topology* below) — top-level fan-out is the permanent model.

## Roster

| Agent | Role | Workspace folder | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Priya](priya.md) | Project Leader | `team/priya-pl/` | Backlog, ClickUp board, scope, schedule, retros, M3 design seeds, process docs |
| [Uma](uma.md) | UX / Visual / Audio Direction | `team/uma-ux/` | Player journey, level UX, palettes, audio direction, boss intros, copy |
| [Devon](devon.md) | Game Developer #1 (engine + harness lead) | `team/devon-dev/` | Engine/runtime, core systems (combat, leveling, save), build/CI, harness infra |
| [Drew](drew.md) | Game Developer #2 (content + level chunks) | `team/drew-dev/` | Content systems (mobs, loot, rooms), level chunks, boss state machines, Playwright fixtures |
| [Tess](tess.md) | QA / Test design | `team/tess-qa/` | Test plans, GUT + Playwright authoring, acceptance plans, sign-off readiness |

- **Sponsor talks to the orchestrator**, not to any single agent. Per `sponsor-decision-delegation`: Sponsor only signs off big deliveries (milestone RCs); orchestrator makes recommended cross-role calls.
- **Devon ↔ Drew peer-review** for both engine-side and game-side PRs as appropriate.
- **Drew or Devon peer-reviews Tess-authored PRs** per `tess-cant-self-qa-peer-review` — pick by surface: game-side → Drew; harness/inventory/engine → Devon.
- **Tess QAs UX-visible PRs from Devon/Drew/Uma** before merge per the testing bar.
- **Priya does NOT spawn peers** — she authors process docs, retros, backlogs, M3 design seeds. The orchestrator dispatches based on her recommendations.

**Why this topology and not Priya-as-fan-out:** Anthropic's Claude Code runtime filters the `Agent` tool out of the toolset exposed to sub-agents (hard-coded in `AgentTool/prompt.ts`), so a spawned Priya cannot itself spawn Devon/Drew/etc. The experimental flag `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is **confirmed inert in this Claude Code build** (per MARIAN-TUTOR's probes 2026-04-24 → 2026-04-25). Top-level fan-out is the permanent model. Re-probe if Anthropic ships native nested-Agent.

## Task lifecycle

1. **Sponsor → Orchestrator:** feature request / soak feedback / direction.
2. **Orchestrator → Priya:** "decompose this" or "add to backlog." Priya drafts ClickUp task(s) with acceptance criteria, suggests assignees + priority. Returns plan.
3. **Orchestrator → Uma** (if UX/visual/audio needed): writes a spec under `team/uma-ux/`. Returns spec.
4. **Orchestrator → Devon or Drew:** branches `{role}/<id>-<slug>`, implements, opens PR. Returns PR # + tight final report (per `tightened-final-report-contract`).
5. **Orchestrator → the other developer:** peer-reviews via `gh pr review`. Approves or blocks.
6. **Orchestrator → Tess:** QA per testing bar. Returns APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES.
7. **Merge** (only after Tess approval; orchestrator triggers via `gh pr merge --admin --squash --delete-branch`).
8. **ClickUp status flip** (paired with merge in same tool round per `clickup-status-as-hard-gate`).

## Models

All five agents are `opus` by default. Embergrave values correctness + Sponsor-soak-finding minimization over throughput. Downgrade to `sonnet` only if a specific lane proves consistently throughput-bound without quality regression.

## Forward-compat note

`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set in `.claude/settings.json` for forward-compat — currently inert. If Anthropic ships native nested-Agent or subagent_type matching for named personas, the persona files in this directory become harness-loadable automatically.
